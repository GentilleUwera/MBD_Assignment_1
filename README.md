Analysis of Milan's Mobile Network Activity
============================================

Overview of the Approach: In this project, I analyzed urban telecommunication patterns by examining a subset of the Mobile Phone Activity dataset, specifically looking at one week of Call Detail Records (CDRs) from Milan. The core of my approach was to process and merge three specific data files (November 2nd, 4th, and 6th) to create a unified view of city-wide activity. Because the original data is spatially aggregated into a grid of 1,000 squares (each roughly 235m x 235m) and temporally aggregated into 60-minute intervals, the first step was to standardize the time formats and extract useful features like the specific hour of the day. By grouping the data by CellID and timestamps, I was able to observe how the city's digital volume fluctuates between different neighborhoods and time periods.

Key Decisions and Data Handling: One of the most important decisions I made during the data preparation phase was how to address missing values. Telecommunication logs often contain gaps where no activity was recorded for a specific cell or service type during an hour. Instead of deleting these records, which would lead to a significant loss of data, or filling them with zeros, I chose to input the missing values using the mean of each respective column. This ensures that the overall statistical distribution of the dataset remains stable while allowing for more accurate aggregate calculations for total SMS, calls, and internet usage. I also decided to filter the country code column using the code "39" to distinguish between domestic Italian traffic and international roaming users, which was essential for a comparative analysis of calling patterns.

Summary of Key Findings: The analysis revealed that Milan follows a very distinct "pulse" that correlates with human movement and social cycles. I found that a vast majority of network activity occurs during the daytime (6 am to 8 pm), with a sharp decline in the early morning hours. When looking at the most common peak hours across the grid, the data typically shows a surge in the early evening. My comparison between domestic and international calls showed that while international activity is a smaller percentage of the total, it has a unique incoming-to-outgoing ratio, often indicating that travelers or international residents receive more calls than they initiate. Finally, I observed a strong correlation between SMS and call volumes at the grid level, suggesting that high-density areas drive all forms of communication simultaneously rather than users favoring one over the other.
